# Predicting-Popularity

The paper titled "Predicting Popularity: A Social Media Experiment" and the Jupyter notebooks explore the use of machine learning models to predict the popularity of social media posts before they are published. Several models were built using natural language processing techniques and sentiment analysis to analyze the text content of posts and predict their popularity. The best model achieved an accuracy of around 80% when classifying posts into four levels of popularity based on up-votes and overall engagement.
